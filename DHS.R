# Author comment ----------------------------------------------------------

# work is progress-
# Standard error calculation takes a long time (more than 1 hour).
# For countries other than Tanzania, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo, complex sample SE have been calculated based on 
# a sample of the actual data available. In addition, Se based on (weighted) random sampling have been added.
# This proivdes an upper an a lower boundary for SEs


# File description, purpose of code, inputs and output --------------------

# this code has been written in order to estimate the survival curves for girls age 0-14 in Ethiopia
# including non-sampling errors (confidence intervals)
# the calculations are based on the microdataset of the 2016 DHS in Ethiopia
